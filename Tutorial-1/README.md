ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A WEBPAGE
===============================

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title> We.LearnAnything Tutorial 1 - HTML Essentials </title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Hello World! </h1>
</body>
</html>


DOCTYPE DECLARATION
===================

What is a Doctype?
------------------


  DOCTYPE declaration is the first element that should appear in source HTML documents. This tag
  is used to identify the version of markup used on the page. For XML this tag can largely be omitted but is essential for HTML to ensure the page is rendered accordingly in the browser.
  In this tutorial series we will primarily be utilizing HTML5 so the following DTD(Document Type Declaration) will suffice.


HTML5 DTD
---------

`<!DOCTYPE html>`


HTML TAG
========

`<html></html>`

What does the "html" tag do?
----------------------------

The html tag is the outer container of your html document. The html tage unto itself only contains
the `<head></head>` tag and the `<body></body>` tag. This is often referred to as the root of a document.


HEAD TAG
========

`<head></head>`

What is the "head" tag?
-----------------------

The head tag instructs the browser on where to find stylesheets and the documents relation to various links within the larger structure of a document. The head tag can also define meta information of the site. In later tutorials we will cover the various elements that can be added to head. For this demo we will only be using the `<title>` tag.

TITLE TAG
=========

`<title></title>`

What does the "title" tag do?
-----------------------------

The title is exactly what it's names implies. It is the name of a given page as it will appear search results, the way it appears at the top of the users tab or browser along with the name that will be automatically assigned if the user creates a bookmark from your page. Assumptively we will cover best title conventions along with some basics concepts of SEO and why naming conventions matter.

BODY TAG
========

`<body></body>`

What does the "body" do?
------------------------

The body tag is the container that wraps around all of your sites content. This tag is in charge of deliminating the elements that will displayed to the user of your website. Body tag often contain headers, paragraphs, images and links to other documents. Simply put, you can think of the body as the display of your document or the actual 'website' users will interact with.



H1 TAG or HEADER TAG
====================

`<h1></h1>`

What is the h1 tag?
-------------------

If you have been coding along with this exercise you may have noticed that the tags used up to this point don't actually render anything in the browser. Well that's because the elements used thus far are structual in nature as apposed to display elements. The H1 tag will be our first attempt at making something show in the browser.

The H1 is hierarchically the most important header on any given document. It should define the purpose of a web page and it's contents. This along with semantic richness is important consider when contemplating SEO.


##Notable Resources
I recommend giving the following resources a once over. We will be using a lot of external tools for homework and independant study assignments. Practice is always the best policy and it is advisable for your own edification for find many informational resoruces.

+_HTML DOG_
  Html Dog has a special place in my heart, it's where I got started experimenting with HTML.
  They have a bunch of great detailed articles to get your feet wet with understanding and practicing HTML syntax.

+_CodeSchool_
  CodeSchool is a paid service but they offer loads of free introductory tutorials and interactive content that will be extraordinarily insightful in your development as a developer. I couldn't recommend them higher. I have provided a link to their FrontEnd Foundations track.

+_CodeAcademy_
  You may as well go ahead and bookmark this one. CodeAcademy is probably the best place on the web to expose yourself to a whole bunch of different web technologies for free in an interactive coding environment. I have elected to pull most of this coarses homework material from the demonstrations found on CodeAcademy.

+_W3 Schools_
  W3 Schools is a great resource for checking syntactical errors and finding singular demonstrations of HTML document construction. Don't confuse this site as an official site of the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/), W3 Schools is simply a handy reference point on your way to Web Dev Mastery.
